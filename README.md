# Climate Monitor

**Decentralized Climate Intelligence: Real-time air quality monitoring powered by AI agents and secured by blockchain**

## The Problem

Climate data today is often unreliable, centralized, and lacks transparency. Citizens need trustworthy, real-time air quality information to make informed health decisions, but traditional monitoring systems are expensive and don't provide actionable insights. There's no decentralized way to access verified climate intelligence on-demand.

## Our Solution

Climate Monitor is a decentralized platform that combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to deliver verified, real-time climate intelligence. When you request air quality data for any location, five specialized AI agents work together to collect, verify, analyze, and provide personalized health recommendations - all secured and paid for through the Cardano blockchain.

## What Makes Us Different

- **CO** - Carbon monoxide levels
- **Temperature** - Current temperature
- **Humidity** - Relative humidity percentage

### Air Quality Index (AQI)
Color-coded health ratings based on EPA standards:
- 🟢 **0-50: Good** - Air quality is satisfactory
- 🟡 **51-100: Moderate** - Acceptable for most people
- 🟠 **101-150: Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups** - May affect children, elderly, and those with respiratory conditions
- 🔴 **151-200: Unhealthy** - Everyone may experience health effects
- 🟣 **201-300: Very Unhealthy** - Health alert for everyone
- 🟤 **301+: Hazardous** - Emergency conditions

### Health Recommendations
Personalized advice for:
- General public
- Sensitive groups (children, elderly, respiratory conditions)
- Outdoor workers
- Athletes and active individuals

### Trend Analysis
